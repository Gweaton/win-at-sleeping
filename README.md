# Win at Sleeping

## Tech test for Crew Studio

My attempts at creating a few of the modules from IKEA's "Win at Sleeping" campaign.

## To Run

- Fork this repo and clone it to your local machine.
- Navigate to the 'win-at-sleeping' directory and run `npm install` from your command line to install the necessary modules for the project (you'll need to have Node Package Manager installed for this).
- Run `http-server ..` from the directory, then visit `localhost: 8080` in your browser.
- To open the webpage, use the links to navigate to 'win-at-sleeping.html'.


## Mobile version

 - This page has a 640px breakpoint, after which it will scale for mobile view.

## Future features

 - Due to time restraints, I have been unable to add the youtube poster wrapper to the page, so the page currently loads the youtube video with no picture on top.
